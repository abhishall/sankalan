story: A Photography Competition is a platform to showcase your talent. While clicking away just for the sake of photography is a lot of fun, sometimes a competition can help you raise the bar as a photographer. Especially when you know your image will be seen by a discerning group of judges, and then possibly displayed alongside those of other winners. So, Sankalan’18 presents to you Alacrity’18, the Photography Competition of DUCS.
details:
    - The contests are open for online submissions only.
    - The photographs can be taken on either of digital cameras or smartphones.
    - Submissions will not be accepted once the deadline lapses.
    - You are required to provide a unique title & description for each image submitted.
    - Basic editing, including color enhancement, the use of filters, and cropping of the photo(s) is acceptable, provided any such editing does not affect the authenticity and/or genuineness of the photo(s).
    - Advanced editing used to create illusions, deceptions and/or manipulations, and the adding and removing of significant elements within the frame is prohibited.
    - Only one submission is allowed per participant, per theme.
    - The <strong>theme</strong> will be updated on our <a href="" target="_blank" rel="nofollow" data-id="fb-page-alacrity">Facebook page</a> every week.
    - <strong>You will have to mail your submissions at <a href="mailto:submit@ducs.in">submit@ducs.in</a>.</strong>

        <strong>Judgment</strong> will be done based on two criteria:
        <ol>
            <li>50 percent of score depends on our judges.</li>
            <li>The other 50 percent is on you. We will post the photographs on our official Facebook page & Instagram Page every night after 12, and it's your duty to increase the number of positive reactions on your photo by sharing with your friends. The one with the highest positive reactions after <attr title="7 days">168 hours</attr> of your picture being posted will score the highest.</li>
        </ol>
    - At the end of every week 3 winners will be announced, and they have to come on April 6-7, 2019 at Dept. of Computer Science, Delhi University (see contact page for details), for the final round.
