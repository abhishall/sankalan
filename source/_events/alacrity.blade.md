story: A Photography Competition is a platform to showcase your talent. While clicking away just for the sake of photography is a lot of fun, sometimes a competition can help you raise the bar as a photographer. Especially when you know your image will be seen by a discerning group of judges, and then possibly displayed alongside those of other winners. So, Sankalan’18 presents to you Alacrity’18, the Photography Competition of DUCS.

- Basic editing, including color enhancement, the use of filters, and cropping of the photo(s) is acceptable, provided any such editing does not affect the authenticity and/or genuineness of the photo(s).
